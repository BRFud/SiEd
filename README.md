# SiEd
This is the original SiEd text editor for Palm OS devices developed by Benjamin Roe. This project was originally developed by Ben Roe and was hosted at [benroe.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20070323092635/http://benroe.com/sied/index.php) which shut down some time in mid-2007.

The final stable version released publically was 0.9.11 released on March 5, 2005 and the final beta version was 0.10-beta3 released on April 27, 2005.

## What Is It?
SiEd is a free simple text editor for Palm OSÂ® based handhelds. Its purpose is to provide an easy way to create and edit large text documents on Palm OS devices, without the limitations of the built-in Memopad program. It's designed mainly for use with an external keyboard of some sort, although of course works fine without. The program is distributed under the GPL.

## Instructions
To install SiEd, just download the latest PRC file and use your favourite Palm desktop sofware to copy the file to your Palm. If you want to hack around with the source or build your own PRC you'll need the prc-tools package and a PalmOS SDK installed.

Using the editor is pretty self explanatory. All commands have a keyboard equivalent (listed in the menus). Documents auto-save on exiting the application. There is a simple User Guide if you need it.
